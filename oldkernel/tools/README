README

This directory contains various scripts for building the tools used for the develoment of Doors OS

In order to generate the cross-compiler the easiest way, these are steps that should be followed.

This is doors/tools

Source code archives are placed in doors/source

Source for the kernel is placed at doors/kernel

Execute apply-patch (after optionally modifying to select the versions you want)
	I should probably add argument handlers for this.
	Make sure you execute the script with ./apply-patch.sh

Execute cross-compile.sh
	Make sure if you modify apply-patch for versions, you do the same for cross-compile
	./cross-compile.sh
