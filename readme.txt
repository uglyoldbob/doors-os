this readme is old
This directory contains the most recent version of Doors. This particular flavor doors will boot using GRUB on a FAT12 formatted floppy disk. Run compile.sh. Then you can copy skeleton.img to a floppy disk or just copy kernel.bin to the root directory of a GRUB formatted floppy disk (disk must have a file system).
