Thoughts on things to do.

File access

The syntax for file access will be similar to Linux
Starts with a '/'
Then the "drive" name
After the drive name will come the partition number
FORM: /device/partition number/folder/folder/file
EX: /floppy1/1, /floppy2/1, /hd1/1, /hd1/2, /cd1/1, /cd2/1
A floppy disk is assumed to not have partitions, but still a partition specifier is required
The first partition is partition 1, not partition 0

Disk access. Everything is in the path name to find the partition required. Both drive number and partition number are given. The text string will need to be run through an interpreter (which might eventually be unicode aware). Once the bootsector for the partition has been located, it will be sent to each file system driver until a match is found.
EX: access for /hd1/2/loser.txt is needed.
	Access hd1. Locate Partition 2.
	Load bootsector for partition 2. The MBR should tell us what kind of filesystem is there. If for some reason, using that driver returns an error, every file system driver will be queried. If no drivers return a success code, then the partition is not usable for some reason. That should generate an error code.
		The FAT driver should/will return an error when reading an NTFS.

findPartition(floppy1/1)
readFile(/floppy1/1/file.txt)
	

Certain information will need to be stored for each drive accessible by this method.
	Drive name (floppya, floppyb, ...)
	Hardware device that data comes from (hardware devices can be emulated to provide support for image files)
	the sector number for the bootsector (contains information about the filesystem)
	
Hardware devices access
	sector_number ranges from 0-whatever
	buffer
	read,write sector
	the appropriate locks so that only one process or thread attempts to access a device at one time
