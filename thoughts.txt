Thoughts on things to do.

File access

The syntax for file access will be similar to Linux
Starts with a '/'
Then the "drive" name (different partitions on a hard drive will have different names)
FORM: /device/folder/folder/file
EX: /floppya, /floppyb, /floppyc, /floppyd

Certain information will need to be stored for each drive accessible by this method.
	Drive name (floppya, floppyb, ...)
	Hardware device that data comes from (hardware devices can be emulated to provide support for image files)
	the sector number for the bootsector (contains information about the filesystem)
	
Hardware devices access
	sector_number ranges from 0-whatever
	buffer
	read,write sector
	the appropriate locks so that only one process or thread attempts to access a device at one time
