DoorsOS version 0.15
	Switched from compile.sh to using make
	Keyboard driver is mostly finished. It could use some customization functions to adjust repeat rates and delays. I also want to make some functions so that "extra" (media keys like volume adjust and similar keys) can be used instead of having their keycodes discarded.
	allocating more than 4KB of memory is functional but slow. It was the first way I thought of to do it that didn't require potentially getting into an infinite loop (I have to allocate memory so I can allocate memory)
	TODO: measure effectiveness of the memory allocation routines
	TODO: finish the spinlock mechanisms (right now only 1 level is functional)

Make all:
	Compiles the kernel if necessary and updates the floppy disk and cd boot images

Make cd:
	Updates the cd boot image and then calls bochs

Make floppy:
	Updates for floppy boot images and the calls bochs
	At the moment, the makefile has to mount a loop back device in order to achieve this
		and that requires root privelages
	Call this as not root, and when the time comes, it will prompt for the password for root access using sudo

make clean:
	Eliminates all object files, the kernel file and the bootable cd image

IMPORTANT for making floppy disk images:
If you want to make a bootable floppy disk image, do not delete Grub.img. If skeleton.img becomes erased or corrupted, then Grub.img is the backup for skeleton.img. The only important thing about these images is that they already have the FAT12 filesystem and GRUB installed on them so only the kernel file (kernel.bin) needs to be copied to them.

Booting from a hard drive.
	This is a pretty easy task if you already have GRUB or some other MULTIBOOT compliant bootloader installed. DoorsOs does not require that it be in a seperate partition at the moment. It will not currently mess anything up when done like shown below.

	An example for GRUB:
		title		DoorsOs
		root		(hd0,1)
		kernel		/home/thomas/DoorsOs/FAT12GRUB/kernel.bin

Network boot:
	This is possible, but I don't know how to set this up right now.
