NO WARRANTY. NO GUARANTEE. I have tried to make this information
accurate. I don't know if I succeeded. Corrections or additional
information would be welcome.

This is a plain-text document. If you use a word-processor to view
it, use a fixed-pitch font (like Courier) so columnar data and
ASCII art lines up properly.

Lessons learned:
- Both the 8048 MCU in the keyboard and the 8042 controller
  on the motherboard accept command bytes.
- There is a bit (KCC) in the poorly-named "Command Byte" which
  seems to enable AT-to-XT scancode conversion (scancode set 2
  to scancode set 1). After booting DOS, my keyboard uses
  scancode set 2 with this conversion bit turned on. If I turn
  the bit off and switch to scancode set 1, operation remains
  the same.
- Scancode set 3 is probably the most elegant, in that it returns
  a one-byte make code for _every_ key. Unfortunately, not all
  keyboards support it.
- The scancodes of some keys depend on the internal num lock state
  of the keyboard.

================================================================
KEYBOARD I/O REGISTERS ON THE PC
================================================================
60h     data
64h     command (write)
64h     Status (read)

Bits in Status register (names from Linux source)
    b7  PERR	parity error in data received from keyboard
    b6  GTO	receive timeout
    b5          transmit timeout (or PS/2 mouse?)
    b4          keyboard is locked
    b3          0=60h was the port last accessed, 1=61h was last (?)
    b2          System Flag status: 0=power-up/reset, 1=selftest OK (?)
    b1  IBF	input buffer full (data from host to keyboard)
    b0	OBF	output buffer full (data from keyboard to host)

Bits in Output Port of 8042 chip (Table P0383 in PORTS.A)
The Output Port is written by controller command D1h,
and read by controller command D0h
    b7          keyboard data output
    b6          keyboard clock output
    b5          input buffer NOT full
    b4          output buffer NOT empty
    b3          (varies)
    b2          (varies)
    b1          A20 gate
    b0          system reset (THIS BIT SHOULD ALWAYS BE SET TO 1)

Bits in Input Port of 8042 chip
The Input Port is read by controller command C0h
    b7          keyboard NOT locked
    b6-b0       (varies)

Bits in "Command Byte" (confusing name; from Table P0404 in PORTS.A)
The "Command Byte" is written by controller command 60h
and read by controller command 20h
(names from Linux source)
    b7          (reserved)
    b6  KCC     convert set 2 scancodes to set 1 ("IBM PC compatibility mode")
    b5  DMS	disables PS/2 mouse when set
    b4          disables keyboard when set
    b3          ignore keyboard lock switch when set
    b2  SYS	System Flag (same as b2 in Status register, it seems)
    b1          enables IRQ12 from PS/2 mouse when set
    b0	EKI	enables IRQ1 on keyboard output buffer full

Result Byte for interface self-tests (Table P0406 in PORTS.A)
Returned by controller commands A9h or ABh
    0           no error
    1           clock line stuck low
    2           clock line stuck high
    3           data line stuck low
    4           data line stuck high

================================================================
CONTROLLER COMMANDS (from Table P0401 of PORTS.A)
================================================================
Before writing each byte of these commands to port 64h,
poll the status register (port 60h) until bit b1=0.

20h-2Fh     	reads byte with address=lower 5 bits of command
                  The byte at address 0 is the "Command Byte".
60h-7Fh nn  	writes byte nn to address=lower 5 bits of command
                  The byte at address 0 is the "Command Byte".
A7h             disables PS/2 mouse port (MCA only?)
A8h             enables PS/2 mouse port (MCA only?)
A9h             self-test mouse interface, returns Result Byte (see above)
AAh             self-test controller; returns 55h if success, FCh if failure
ABh             self-test keyboard interface, returns Result Byte (see above)
ADh             disables keyboard (sets b4 of "Command Byte")
AEh             enables keyboard (clears b4 of "Command Byte")
C0h         	reads Input Port
D0h         	reads Output Port
D1h nn      	writes Output Port
                  Important: bit 0 (system reset) should always be set here,
                  as the system may hang constantly. To reset the PC, pulse
                  b0 of the Output Port with command FEh instead.
DDh             disable A20 (Not all systems support this byte)
DFh             enable A20 (Not all systems support this byte)
E0h         	read test inputs. return value=
		    b1      kbd data
		    b0      kbd clock
EDh nn      	write LEDs. nn=
		    b2      Caps Lock
		    b1      Num Lock
		    b0      Scroll Lock
F0h-FFh     	pulse bit(s) of Output Port low for 6 microseconds.
                  If b0-b3 of the command is low, the corresponding bit
                  in the Output Port will be pulsed low. b0=system reset,
                  and should ALWAYS be PULSED low, never set low constantly.

================================================================
KEYBOARD COMMANDS (from Table P0386 of PORTS.A)
================================================================
Before writing each byte of these commands to port 60h,
poll the status register (port 60h) until bit b1=0.
Unless otherwise noted: each command responds with FAh (ACKnowledge)
or FEh (Resend) after receiving each byte of the command.

EDh nn      	write LEDs, as above
EEh         	echo, keyboard responds with EEh
EFh         	no-operation (reserved)
F0h nn      	selects scancode set nn=1-3 or 0 to return current set
F2h         	read ID. Keyboard responds with ACK (FAh) and two optional
		ID bytes:
		    (none)	AT keyboard
		    83h ABh   	(?)
		    ABh 41h   	MF2, translation mode
		    ABh 83h   	MF2, pass-through mode
F3h nn          set typematic (auto-repeat) rate/delay. nn=
		    b7      unused
		    b6..5   Repeat delay (00=250 msec ... 11=1000msec)
                    b4..0   Repeat rate (00000=30 Hz ... 11111=2 Hz).
F4h         	clears output buffer, enables keyboard
F5h             disables keyboard, resets to defaults
F6h             sets keyboard defaults

F7h             make all keys typematic (auto-repeat)   [*]
F8h             make all keys make-break                [*]
F9h             make all keys make-only                 [*]
FAh             make all keys typematic and make-break  [*]
FBh nn          make one key typematic                  [*]
FCh nn          make one key make-break                 [*]
FDh nn          make one key make-only                  [*]
                        [*] these commands may work only for
                            scancode set 3; I'm not sure.
FEh         	resend previous scan code
FFh         	reset keyboard CPU, do power-on self-test, return
		self-test result byte

non-key status bytes
--------------------
00h    Key detection error or buffer full.
AAh    Power-on/reset diagnostics successful.
E0h    (scancode sets 1 and 2) Prefix byte for "gray" keys
        (keys not on original 83-/84-key keyboard)
EEh    Sent in response to ECHO command.
F0h    (scancode sets 2 and 3) Prefix byte for break codes.
FAh    ACKknowledge; response to most commands.
FCh    Diagnostics failed (MF keyboard).
FDh    Diagnostics failed (AT keyboard).
        The keyboard stops scanning and waits for next command
        after returning code FCh or FDh
FEh    Last command was invalid or had parity error; resend it.
FFh    Key detection error or buffer full.

====================================================================
SCANCODES FOR SCANCODE SET 1 (XT)
====================================================================
US 104-key keyboard, set 1 scancodes


"Make" code is generated when key is pressed.
"Break" code is generated when key is released.
Hex value of make code for each key is shown.

Most keys:
	one-byte make code	= nn
	one-byte repeat code	= nn
	one-byte break code	= 80h + nn

"Gray" keys (not on original 84-key keyboard):
	two-byte make code	= E0nn
	two-byte repeat code	= E0nn
	two-byte break code	= E0 followed by 80h + nn

"Gray" keys noted by [1] are NumLock-sensitive.
When the keyboard's internal NumLock is active:
	four-byte make code	= E02AE0nn
	two-byte repeat code	= E0nn
	four-byte break code	= E0 followed by 80h + nn followed by E0AA

Hex value of make code for each key is shown.

All keys:
	one-byte make code	= nn
	one-byte repeat code	= nn
	two-byte break code	= F0nn

When operating in scancode set 3, the keyboard
does not maintain an internal NumLock state.
